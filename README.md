# Inhouse bot

Inhouse Bot is a discord bot. It is also an inhouse ranking system intended for League of Legends (can be easily altered for other games). The bot will support various commands asynchronously with multiple users at once. It will track and maintain the progress of each lobby and will report the winners and losers upon match completion. The system will use an elo rating system. It will also include a verification system to ensure all registered players have a legitimate account from League of Legends. Having this inhouse bot will enable smaller communities to track and reward their most active members.
